# ecommerce-RDS
High Level of my approach 


1.	First, I will set up the AWS provider in my Terraform configuration file. Where I will specify my AWS credentials, region, and other settings as needed.
2.	I will then Define a VPC for my RDS instance. I will use the VPC module provided by Terraform
3.	I will Set up a security group to control access to the RDS instance. I will only allow traffic from my EC2 instances
4.	I will create a subnet group to specify the subnets where my RDS instance will be deployed. I will choose the subnets from my VPC, making sure they are in different availability zones for high availability.
5.	I will use the AWS RDS Terraform module to deploy the RDS instance itself, specifying the engine, instance class, storage capacity, and other settings 
6.	I will enable multi-AZ deployment to ensure high availability, failover, and automatic backups.
7.	I will set up the database configuration, including the name, credentials, and other parameters. I will use Terraform variables to parameterize all configuration and make it reusable.
8.	I will use AWS RDS Terraform module to define the database schema, tables, and other objects as needed.
9.	Run terraform plan, review all changes and apply the Terraform configuration. Terraform will create the RDS instance, subnets, security groups, and other resources as needed.
10.	I will Test the RDS instance by connecting to it from my EC2 instances.
